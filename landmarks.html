            <h1>Minhla Fort</h1>
            <p>Minhla Fortress (Burmese language: မင်းလှခံတပ်) is a historic fortress located in Minhla, Magway Region, Myanmar. The fortress was built in 1860 to 1861 to defend the Konbaung dynasty's territory following the Second Anglo-Burmese War. It was built with the assistance of French and Italian engineers, including Captain Molinari, an Italian engineer, along the western bank of the Irrawaddy River.

                This fort, along with the Gwegyaung Fortress, was used as a defensive point of resistance by Burmese troops during the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885.</p>

            <h1>Secretariat Yangon</h1>
            <p>The Ministers' Building (Burmese: ဝန်ကြီးများရုံး; also called the Ministers' Office; is today known as The Secretariat or Secretariat Yangon) was the home and administrative seat of British Burma, in downtown Yangon, Burma and is the spot where Aung San and six cabinet ministers were assassinated. The British administration moved the office from Strand Road after administrative work increased greatly resulting in an urgent need to expand the cramped and poorly lit administration building.</p>
            <p>The building is situated on 6.5 hectares (16 acres) and takes up an entire city block with Anawrahta Road to the north, Theinbyu Road to the east, Maha Bandoola Road to the south and Bo Aung Kyaw Street to the west. It is about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) South East of Yangon Central Railway Station and 600 metres (2,000 ft) east of the Sule Pagoda.</p>

            <h1>Bandula fort</h1>
            <p>General Maha Bandula (Burmese: မဟာဗန္ဓုလ [məhà bàɰ̃dṵla̰] 6 November 1782 to 1 April 1825) was commander-in-chief of the Royal Burmese Armed Forces from 1821 until his death in 1825 in the First Anglo-Burmese War. Bandula was a key figure in the Konbaung dynasty's policy of expansionism in Manipur and Assam that ultimately resulted in the war and the beginning of the downfall of the dynasty. Nonetheless, the general, who died in action, is celebrated as a national hero by the Burmese for his resistance to the British. Today, some of the most prominent places in the country are named after him.</p>
            <p>this is his fort and there's his grave and his memorial park near it</p>
